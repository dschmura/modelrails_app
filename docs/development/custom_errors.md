# Custom Errors
[Home](./README.md) / [Development](development/README.md)

The ModelRails template uses custom error handling to add our customizations. 

**IMPORTANT** This approach overrides the Ruby on Rails default of using the 404.html and 500.html pages in the public directory. 

**IMPORTANT** The default 404 and 500 files should remain in the event that the Rails App is not working. [Is this true?]
